## What's GalaXseeds?
Now defunct, GalaXseeds was a browser-based Flash MMO created by Firma Studios & Corus Entertainment.

## Remastered? What happened to the original?
GalaXseeds was taken offline alongside many Flash games when HTML5 started overtaking Flash sometime after 2010.  Rather than rewrite games from scratch, many companies took their games down.
